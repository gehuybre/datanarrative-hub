## Design Direction

The design should feel authoritative and scholarly while remaining approachable - like a digital research journal that makes complex data accessible to broader audiences through clean Material Design 3 principles.

## Color Selection

Complementary (opposite colors) - Using a sophisticated blue-orange complementary scheme that conveys both trustworthiness (blue) and energy/insight (orange).

- **Primary Color**: Deep Ocean Blue (oklch(0.45 0.12 240)) - Communicates trustworthiness and data authority
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays (oklch(0.9 0.01 240) to oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) for text hierarchy and backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Orange (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - Highlights insights and call-to-action elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 15.8:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue oklch(0.98 0.01 240)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0.01 240)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.12 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange oklch(0.7 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should balance readability for long-form content with clarity for data labels - using Inter for its excellent screen readability and numerical clarity.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Report Titles): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body (Report Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Caption (Chart Labels): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing
  - Code (Data Values): Inter Mono/14px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that guide attention to insights without overwhelming the data - focusing on smooth transitions during report navigation and chart interactions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion emphasizes data relationships and guides users through narrative flow
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Chart transitions > page navigation > micro-interactions > hover states

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card for report previews, Dialog for chart export options, Tabs for report sections, Table for data display, Button with variants for actions, Input for search functionality
- **Customizations**: Custom chart container component that wraps Plotly with export controls, Custom report template component for consistent layout
- **States**: Buttons show loading states during exports, Charts display skeleton loading, Search shows results/empty states
- **Icon Selection**: Download for exports, Search for discovery, Share for embed codes, Chart icons for visualization types
- **Spacing**: Consistent 16px base unit with 24px for section spacing, 8px for tight groupings
